# Hyperion
Auth made easy

Hyperion is a simple code that does user authentication. It uses Node.js, React.js, MySQL, Passportjs to to do user authentication.

The whole reason for the repo to exist is the lack of resources for React and Passportjs authentication. There are itsy bitsy stuff that specifically matter in authentication.
Like the frontend(React) and backend(Node) is connected via proxy, wouldn't work otherwise.
Feel free to make the system more simpler and secure
